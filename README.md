**PRESS THE PLAY BUTTON ON THE TOP LEFT**

----------------------------

Spawn chickens and click on them to hear them cluck and bounce them around.

Click on the chicken to hear it cluck and launch it randomly in a two-dimensional direction, bouncing around the borders as its boundaries. Clicking on the gray circle will spawn more chickens instances that act exactly like the first chicken.

This was my first project using p5.js.
